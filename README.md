# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
This project explores a sample bike sales dataset using Excel. I built an interactive dashboard that tracks key metrics like revenue, customer demographics, and regional trends. The goal was to practice data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualization techniques to deliver clear business insights that support data-driven decision making.
